# Operationalizing Machine Learning in Azure ML Studio

## Overview

* This project is a part Machine Learning Engineer with Microsoft Azure Nanodegree program.

* In this project we implemented end-to-end machine learning project cycle in Azure ML studio. We used Azure ML to create and train the model with AutoML functionality and deploy it. 

* We also created a pipeline to create the model, deploy the model and consumed the model.

* Also the end-point URL of the deployed model is exposed to end-user which they can consume it with sample data.


## Architectural Diagram
![](images/arc.png)
*TODO*: Provide an architectual diagram of the project and give an introduction of each step. An architectural diagram is an image that helps visualize the flow of operations from start to finish. In this case, it has to be related to the completed project, with its various stages that are critical to the overall flow. For example, one stage for managing models could be "using Automated ML to determine the best model". 

## Key Steps
*TODO*: Write a short discription of the key steps. Remeber to include all the screenshots required to demonstrate key steps. 

## Screen Recording
*TODO* Provide a link to a screen recording of the project in action. Remember that the screencast should demonstrate:

## Standout Suggestions
*TODO (Optional):* This is where you can provide information about any standout suggestions that you have attempted.
